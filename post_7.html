          <p> <strong>Necropolis</strong> is considered an imbalanced city and is often banned from tournaments. This
            stems from two whole ways of replenishing the army inaccessible to other castles: </p>
          <div> - the resurrection of losing opponents in the form of skeletons after the battle (<i>Necromancy
              Amplifier</i> and special artifacts increases the number of raised creatures); </div>
          <div> - the ability to turn creatures of any other faction into undead (<i>Skeleton Transformer</i>). </div>

          <p> Also, there are two ways to resurrect units that have fallen in the battle in such a way that after the
            battle they remain in the army: </p>
          <div> - casting <i>Animate Dead</i> spell will resurrect any unit of the dead army; </div>
          <div> - Vampire Lords resurrect by damaging enemies. </div>

          <p> <i>Playing for Necropolis, I suggest you to aim to enhance the above advantages.</i> </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Some tips to consider</h2>

          <p> <strong>Hero tips</strong> </p>

          <p> When <i>choosing a hero</i>, I advise you to choose Thant. This mage, with its enhanced <i>Animate
              Dead</i>, keeps troop losses in combat to a minimum. Thant casts Animate Dead with increased effect, based
            on his level compared to the level of the target unit. </p>

          <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-thumbnail" src="https://heroes.thelazy.net/images/a/a1/Hero_Thant.png"
            alt="">

          <p> <i>Developing Thant as the main character</i> you need to choose <i>Earth Magic</i> to increase <i>Animate
              Dead</i> spell effects. Deth army is very slow, to avoid such a disadvantage you need to take Logistics.
            Take <i>Wisdom</i> to cast high-level spells. <i>Tactics</i> is another good choice that will make your slow
            units (skeletons and zombies) more useful in the first minutes of each battle. In sum we have
            <i>Necromancy</i> (default), <i>Mysticism</i> (default), <i>Earth Magic</i>, <i>Logistics</i>,
            <i>Wisdom</i>. The other slots you can choose by yourself. </p>

          <p> <strong>Skeleton Transformer tips</strong> </p>
          <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-thumbnail"
            src="https://heroes.thelazy.net/images/thumb/d/d7/Necropolis_skeleton_transformer_%28outline%29.gif/200px-Necropolis_skeleton_transformer_%28outline%29.gif"
            alt="">
          <p> During the game, you need to have some heroes to collect free/chip units on the map. These units need to
            be transformed into sceletons using Skeleton Transformer. Also, think about skill <i>Diplomacy</i> for the
            second hero. This skill will allow you to get extra units that also can be transformed into skeletons.
            Another interesting tip is that if you will use any living dragon to transfer into a skeleton, you will get
            the Skeleton dragon. </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">The main army suggestions</h2>
          <p>
          <div> <strong>For the main army I suggest:</strong> </div>
          <div> <strong>Stage One:</strong> Skeletons, Power Liches, and Dread Knights; </div>
          <div> <strong>Stage Two:</strong> Skeleton Warriors, Power Liches, Dread Knights and Vampire Lords; </div>
          <div> <strong>Stage Three:</strong> Skeleton Warriors, Power Liches Dread Knights, Vampire Lords, and Ghost
            dragons. </div>
          </p>

          <p>
          <h4> <u> Skeleton warriors 6/6/6/1-3/5/70 </u></h4>
          <img class="rounded img-thumbnail" src="https://guides.gamepressure.com/heroes3hd/gfx/word/356083514.jpg"
            alt="">
          <div> Based on the advantages of Necropolice, the numbers of this unit will be high. Numbers = strength.
            Skeleton warriors are raised after a battle like skeletons, but only if you don't have normal skeletons in
            the army and all slots are occupied. </div>
          </p>

          <p>
          <h4> <u>Power Liches 13/10/40/11-15/7/600</u> </h4>
          <img class="rounded img-thumbnail" src="https://homm3sod.ru/images/content/78.jpg" alt="">
          <div> Area attack is the main power of Power Liches. </div>
          </p>

          <p>
          <h4> <u> Dread knights 18/18/120/15-30/9/1500</u> </h4>
          <img class="rounded img-thumbnail" src="https://homm3sod.ru/images/content/79.jpg" alt="">
          <div>Good attack and defense stats. Can curse enemies. Chance to deathblows, which cause double damage. The
            strongest unit of Necropolice and one of the most powerful level 6 creatures in the game.</div>
          </p>

          <p>
          <h4> <u> Vampire Lords 10/10/40/5-8/9/500</u> </h4>
          <img class="rounded img-thumbnail" src="https://homm3sod.ru/images/content/77.jpg" alt="">
          <div>Enemies don't respond to attack. Use it wisely - attack strong enemies with Vampire Lords first. Vampire
            Lords resurrect by damaging enemies. You need to include Vampire Lords in your army only when you can afford
            a big number of them. 200 Vampire Lords is a very strong enemy.</div>
          </p>

          <p>
          <h4> <u> Ghost dragons 19/17/200/25-50/14/3000 + 1m</u> </h4>
          <img class="rounded img-thumbnail" src="https://homm3sod.ru/images/content/80.jpg" alt="">
          <div>Good speed. Lower morale of the enemy army. Can cast an aging attack that halves the enemy's health.
          </div>
          </p>

          <p> <strong>Necropolis is considered as one of the most powerful castles in Heroes of Might and Magic
              3</strong>. It is also one of the most interesting castles to play. The advantages of Necropolis
            become stronger on bigger maps where you have time to generate an army of undead. Avoid using Necropolis on
            small maps (in short games). Be careful in the first stages of the game - in the first weeks Necropolis is
            quite weak - you can be easily defeated. Use <i>Animate Dead</i> wisely to limit unit losses, collect units,
            and you will win. </p>
