        <p>My name is Anton Talalaev and I am a Software Developer. I live in Canada and work in EvoTrux, the company
          that provides services for shippers and carriers throughout Canada and the US. I became a Software Developer
          not a long time ago, but my career path started 10 years ago. I assume that my story is quite interesting and
          a bit inspirational for other people. Let me share it with you.</p>
        <p>I started my career path as a legal specialist in a big power generation company in Russia. Overall, I have 8
          years of successful work experience in the Law field and I even managed to become a Head of the Legal
          Department in the biggest Clinical Institute of the Moscow region. I was responsible for such business
          processes as consulting, analysing, finance, tenders, and administering business processes. </p>
        <p>During the last 5 years, I began to show interest in programming. I always loved data analysis and building
          financial models. During my legal career, I became quite good at using Excel and Visual Basic for Applications
          (VBA). Once, I started to learn programming with the C language but just for fun. I never thought to change my
          career because there were lots of benefits starting from the salary range and ending with really good medical
          insurance. For a couple of years, I felt bad about my job and the responsibilities that I executed. At this
          period, I many times caught myself thinking I would love to create the programs to describe the whole business
          processes, to automate casual tasks, to manage the processes from outside, not from inside.</p>
        <p> One day my wife told me that I had to quit and to enrol in a brand-new coding school that was just opened in
          Moscow. She said that she will give me one year to become a Software Developer. During this year she promised
          to work and to care for our daughter on her own. It was a hard decision for me to do so but I never regret it.
          Soon I quit and enrolled in a peer-based coding school "42 Network". After the 6 months of my studies, I found
          the first job in the IT field in the largest bank of Russia. I successfully worked there in an agile team for
          7 months. In January 2020 my family and I moved to Canada and started a new life from the very beginning. Here
          I soon become a Software Developer again and would love to share with you my experience in future posts.</p>
