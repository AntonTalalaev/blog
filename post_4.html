          <p> Getting the job is always a very tricky thing to do, especially if you want to get a job at Google. </p>
          <p> As for me, I would suggest to go through the shortlist above and do each step as best as you can. </p>

          <div class="img-container img-container-50">
            <img id="screenshot_trusted_CA" class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/post_4-google-1.png"
              alt="We are hiring image">
            <blockquote class="caption text-muted">
              <label for="img_event_listeners_1">We are hiring!</label>
            </blockquote>
          </div>

          <p> So, this is my suggestions: </p>

          <p>
          <div> 1) Do research about job requirements. </div>
          <div> You will need to find open vacancies in Google company. You will need to check such aggregators as
            Indeed, network LinkedIn, and Google (or other aimed company) career page. </div>
          <div> This work will give you knowledge about the desired stack of technologies, level of experience,
            professional certificates, and education. </div>
          </p>

          <p>
          <div> 2) Do your best to become the perfect candidate: </div>
          <div> - learn technologies with which you are not familiar yet, </div>
          <div> - try to get appropriate work experience, </div>
          <div> - go through appropriate certifications. </div>
          </p>
          <p>
          <div> 3) Find Google employees on LinkedIn and research their accounts. You will need two things: </div>
          <div> - to make your own account looks similar, </div>
          <div> - to find certifications and courses that such professionals went through, and decide, do you need to do
            the same or not. </div>
          </p>
          <p> 4) Based on made research, create a good resume and cover letter. Maybe you will need some help. There are
            lots of companies that provide such services. </p>
          <p> 5) In LinkedIn you will need to become a contactee of tech stack employees of Google, more - better. Just
            send requests. </p>

          <div class="img-container img-container-50">
            <img id="screenshot_trusted_CA" class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/post_4-google-2.png"
              alt="interview image">
            <blockquote class="caption text-muted">
              <label for="img_event_listeners_1">Interview</label>
            </blockquote>
          </div>

          <p> 6) After step 5, I suggest you try to get informational interviews, at least a few. You should think about
            questions a bit, google it. </p>
          <p> 7) You also can ask for help from your new contacts - to skim your resume, or even ask to send your resume
            to the recruiter team (a few times I was able to get such help, not in Google of course). </p>
          <p> 8) Search as much as you can about the interview process at Google. There are tons of data about it on the
            Web, also you can find a few books. And prepare hard. </p>
