Jessica's Feedback:
About Me Page - Quite a career so far! A few spelling/grammar errors in your last paragraph. Also, this page was supposed to include 3 original photos. 
Contact Page - "Feel" free
Blog Page - Nice! It might be better to use a different text format for your blurbs - your current one separates some of your text awkwardly.
Text Formatting	- Consider indenting bulleted lists (this might just be in the md assignment). 
Updated Writing Tasks	-	Some spelling/grammar mistakes.
New Original Post	- Personal branding. "How to start TO develop.." Make sure your image captions really make sense to what the image is. Good things to consider.
