          <p>
            Nowadays, personal branding is one of the most popular topics on the Internet and has different variations
            of meaning. I made research through the Internet and formulated the meaning of this term for myself. Being a
            brand means having a built image with a predictable result, having your target audience, and being able to
            create a reputation that will correspond to your business objectives. This means, that before you create
            your personal brand you have to do lots of analytical work to understand yourself.

          <p> First of all, I would recommend starting from two imaginary points A and B. </p>
          <p> <strong>Point A</strong> - is where you are now. It includes your skills, your experience, your level of
            awareness in the IT industry. </p>

          <p> <strong>Point B</strong> - you in the future. Imagine what kind of specialist you would like to be. Think
            about the level of the desired influence in the industry, the level of your future projects, write down the
            financial and non-material parameters that you would like to have. </p>

          <p> When you determined the starting point and the desired point, answer the following questions: </p>
          <ol>
            <li> Why are you creating your personal brand? </li>
            <li> In what niche of the IT Development industry you want to create your brand? </li>
            <li> Analyze your competitors and answer the questions: what separates you from your competitors? What do
              you disagree with in the niche? </li>
            <li> Who is your target audience? </li>
            <li> Which personal facets are you willing to broadcast to people? </li>
            <li> What kind of specialist/person do people see, how do you look like? </li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <img id="screenshot_trusted_CA" class="img-fluid rounded img-thumbnail" src="./img/posts/post_5-branding-2.png"
            alt="New Brand Strategy image">
          <blockquote class="caption text-muted">
            <label for="img_event_listeners_1">Development</label>
          </blockquote>
          <p> As soon as you have done all these preparation steps, you can work under your network representation: </p>
          <ol>
            <li> Create your brand name. It would be great if it is short, memorable, and reflects your personality.
            </li>
            <li> Create your website with a Blog section, create a Youtube channel. </li>
            <li> Be active on Instagram, LinkedIn, GitHub, Stackoverflow. </li>
            <li> Be active and develop your local IT community. </li>
            <li> Attend meetups and other IT events. </li>
            <li> Take part in Hackathons. </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            And one more tip - never stop developing as a programmer. Always learn new technologies, stay up to date
            with industry news, and get new certifications according to your Point B.
