            Information technology development has led to the creation of a whole online world with specific rules
            of communication, safety rules, and a large number of personal accounts. An ordinary
            person can have well over 5 different personal accounts with personal information. To access
            their account, a person has to “log in”, which means entering a username and password. It is really hard to
            memorize login information for all existing accounts. To make it easier, quite often, people choose to use
            one password for all accounts.
          </p>

          <p class="font-italic">
            <u>Even though one password is much easier to memorize, this method of password management has some
              critical negative effects.</u>
          </p>

            This article will cover the very real consequences

          <div class="text-center font-weight-bold">
            of having one password for all accounts

          <p>
            Now just imagine that cybercriminals hack into one of the Internet sites on which you have a
            personal account. Then your personal data, such as phone number, date of birth, mailing address, password to
            the hacked account, etc. go to a special dataset of hacked accounts. Such databases are themselves used as
            standalone black market goods. But the most dangerous is that such databases are used by malefactors to hack
            other online services and payment systems.
          </p>

            <img id="img_password_management_2" class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/post_3-password_management_2.png"
              alt="">
            <blockquote class="caption text-muted">
              <label for="img_password_management_2">Just a funny picture</label>

          </div>

          <p>
            In this case, if you've used the same password for all of your accounts. One hacked website,
            where you had an account, puts all your other accounts at risk. You can lose access to your social accounts, 
            email, and other accounts. If you didn't set recoverying setting, some accounts that were stolen, you will 
            never be able to return or restore.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, cybercriminals can steal your PlayStation game account, where all games that were purchased online in
            the digital version. In the case of a stolen social account, all friends of yours can receive messages from you
            where they will be told that you need a small amount of money urgently, and a mobile phone or a bank account
            to transfer the asked amount. 
          </p>

          <p>
            In conclusion, I would like to give you a shortlist of useful pieces of advice on how to protect yourself 
            from getting hacked:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Don’t use the same password for multiple accounts.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don’t use the same password for multiple accounts. The reason for that I already described above.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some online services provide you an opportunity to “sign-in” using linked accounts Facebook/Google/Other.
              Don’t use a Facebook account or any other account to create accounts that you are not ready to lose (only
              for one-time services).
            </li>
            <li>
              Always use two-factor authentication where it is possible. Nowadays, this is the best way to
              keep an account secure.
            </li>
            <li>
              Always set a recovery setting everywhere where it is possible. Such settings usually include trusted
              email addresses, mobile phones, and security questions. Such settings are the only way to restore your
              account in case it will be stolen.
            </li>
          </ul>
