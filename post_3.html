            Information technology development has led to the creation of a whole online world with its specific rules
            of communication, safety rules, and a big amount of personal accounts. It is not a secret that an ordinary
            person at the same time can have over 5 different personal accounts with personal information. To enter into
            the account a person has to “login”, which means to enter username and password. It is really hard to
            memorize login information for all existing accounts. To make it easier, quite often, people choose to use
            one password for all accounts.
          </p>

          <p class="font-italic">
            <u>Even though one password is much easier to memorize, such methods of password management have some
              critical
              negative effects.</u>

            Nowadays it is very common when cybercriminals hack into one of the Internet sites on which you have a
            personal account. Then your personal data, such as phone number, date of birth, mailing address, password to
            the hacked account, etc. go to a special dataset of hacked accounts. Such databases are themselves used as
            standalone black market goods. But the most dangerous is that such databases are used by malefactors to hack
            other online services and payment systems.

            Now imagine that you used the same password for all accounts of yours. In this case, one hacked website,
            where you had an account, puts all your other accounts and your finances at risk. In the best-case scenario,
            you can lose access to your social accounts, email, and other accounts.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, cybercriminals can steal your PlayStation game account, where all games that were purchased in
            the digital version. In case of a stolen social account, all friends of yours can receive messages from you
            where they will be told that you need a small amount of money urgently, and a mobile phone or a bank account
            to transfer the asked amount. Also, some accounts that were stolen, you will never be able to return or
            restore.
          </p>

          <p>
            In conclusion, I would like to give you a shortlist of useful tips to decrease risks, related to password
            management:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              First of all, sure you need a strong password, which typically should include numbers, symbols, and
              capital letters. However, the password you choose should not be too complex.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don’t use the same password for multiple accounts. The reason for that I already described above.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some online services provide you an opportunity to “sign in” using linked accounts Facebook/Google/Other.
              Don’t use a Facebook account or any other account to create accounts that you are not ready to lose (only
              for one-time services).
            </li>
            <li>
              Always use two-factor authentication everywhere where it is possible. Nowadays this is the best way to
              keep an account secure.
            </li>
            <li>
              Always set a recovering setting everywhere where it is possible. Such settings usually include trusted
              email addresses, mobile phones, and security questions. Such settings are the only way to restore your
              account in case it will be stolen.
            </li>
          </ul>
