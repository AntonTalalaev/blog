          <p>Nowadays, online fraud such as credit card fraud, account takeover, promo abuse, etc. began more and more
            popular. Here I will cover web security-related topic that definitely will be useful to know about. </p>

          <p>Probably you wondered, why do sites with <code>http://</code> in the address (URL) cause an unsafe
            connection alert in
            the browser, as opposed to sites with <code>https://</code> in the address? </p>

          <p>In simple terms, the absence of ‘s’ in <code>http://</code> means that the site you visit <strong>cannot
              guarantee the safety of
              your data transmitted to the site</strong>. The <code>https://</code> in the address of the site indicates
            that data transmission
            between the user (client) and the site (server) is carried out using a <i>secure encryption protocol</i>.
          </p>

          <p>In order to understand this issue, I propose to dig a bit dipper. </p>

          <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP">Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</a> - the
            basic protocol for transferring data between a user (client) and a
            web-site (server). HTTP describes things like request and response, sessions, cache, authentication, and
            more. </p>

          <p>Using HTTP, data is sent between network users in <i>plain text</i>, allowing users to see the content.
            However,
            having intercepted such data, the attacker does not have any difficulties in interpreting it. This raises a
            security issue. So, in 1994 Netscape Communications developed and introduced HTTP Secure (HTTPS), which
            allows a client and server to <strong>first establish an encrypted connection and then send HTTP messages
              over it</strong>.
            HTTPS is not a separate protocol. This is normal HTTP, that works over <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">
              SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security)</a> encrypted transport mechanisms. </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Differences between SSL and TLS </h2>

          <p><strong>SSL is a cryptographic protocol for secure communication.</strong> Since version 3.0 SSL has been
            replaced by TLS,
            but the name of the previous version stuck, therefore today SSL is most often referred to as TLS. Today, TLS
            and SSL technologies are used to guarantee encryption of traffic between client and a server. </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">How does it all work?</h2>

          <p>The principle of SSL and TLS is the same. On top of the data transfer protocol, an encrypted channel is
            established, within which data is transferred using the HTTP protocol. <strong>Only the machine that
              established the
              connections can decrypt the transmitted data</strong>. For everyone else who receives the transmitted
            packets (e.g.
            intruders), this information will be meaningless if they cannot decrypt it. </p>

          <p>All sites using SSL certificates ensure that the site supports three important features at once: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Confidentiality </li>
            <li>Integrity</li>
            <li>Identification</li>
          </ul>

          <p>SSL certificates are issued by a <strong>publicly trusted certificate authority (CA)</strong>. CA are
            industry-trusted
            organizations that issue Internet certificates. They are responsible for the quality of service and provide
            guarantees of the reliability of the SSL certificate. If the user suffers due to the vulnerability of the
            certificate, he will be paid monetary compensation. </p>

          <p>Each browser contains a list of trusted CAs. Sites with SSL certificates from this list are considered safe
            for the user. </p>

          <img id="screenshot_trusted_CA" class="img-fluid" src="./images/posts/post_1-SSL-certificates.png"
            alt="Screenshot: List of trusted CAs in Chrome browser">
          <blockquote class="caption text-muted">
            <label for="screenshot_trusted_CA">List of trusted CAs in Chrome browser </label>
            <div>(section Settings - Privacy and security - security - manage certificates - system roots)</div>
          </blockquote>

          <p>If the site's SSL certificate was issued by a valid certification center, the user's browser recognizes it
            as trusted (authentication) and encrypts its data using the public key. Even if an attacker intercepts the
            information transmitted by the user (for example, credit card details for paying for an order), he will not
            be able to read it, since he does not have a private key to decrypt the data. </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Let's summarize</h2>

          <p>Safe and efficient transmission of data over open communication channels is a critical component of a
            modern IT system, and SSL provides this security. </p>
